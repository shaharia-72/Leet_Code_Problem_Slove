#Competitive Programming Repository
This repository contains solutions to programming problems from HackerRank, Codeforces, and LeetCode. Competitive programming is a type of sport that involves solving complex programming problems under time pressure. It's a great way to improve your programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and logical thinking.

Getting Started
To use this repository, simply clone the repository using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/competitive-programming.git


bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/competitive-programming.git
Make sure to replace <your_username> with your GitHub username.

Usage
The repository is organized by platform and language. Each platform has a separate folder and each folder contains subfolders for each language. For example, the HackerRank folder contains subfolders for C, C++, and Python.

Within each language folder, you will find the solutions to the problems implemented in that language. The solutions are named after the problem and include the platform name and the problem ID. For example, the solution to the first problem on HackerRank implemented in C++ would be named HackerRank_P1.cpp.

In competitive programming, it's important to not only solve the problems but also to optimize your solutions for time and space complexity. Therefore, the solutions in this repository are not only correct but also optimized for efficiency.

Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to submit a pull request. Make sure to include a clear and concise description of the problem and the solution, as well as any relevant test cases.

In addition, you can also contribute by adding new problems to the repository. Just make sure to follow the same folder structure and naming conventions as the existing solutions.
